#studentRegister is a Springboot application that allows the user to create new data on a MySQL database with a student profile which contains the student's name, their course, their birthdate and their code, which is unique for each student. It allows the user to get all the students from the database and also get the student by their code or name. The program allows the user to edit the information through a @PathMapping and to secure the information doesn't get lost, it has a boolean property to monitor the status as active or unactive. Implemented on an interface, it uses JPA hibernate to persist and to get the data, passing through a record DTO to manage the object from a JSON to a Java Object and the other way around while using inversion of control and depency injection to manage beans.
